===================
Optimisation Kernel
===================

PolyMPC is a collection of carefully optimised and loosely coupled numerical optimisation algorithms.
This means that all available methods can be used completely independently of each other and of a particular problem structure.
At the same time, the software architecture allows one to seamlessly combine the algorithmic blocks employing the template mechanism
in C++ to enable the solution of complex nonlinear optimisation and optimal control problems. In the following, we present a brief overview
of the available algorithms for numerical optimisation.
