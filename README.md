## Description

PolyMPC an open-source C++ library for real-time embedded nonlinear optimal control that combines high computational performance, modularity and a simple and intuitive user interface. PolyMPC is a lightweight collection of optimised and loosely coupled tools for nonlinear optimisation and optimal control which includes several quadratic programming (QP) and nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers, quasi-Newton Hessian approximation and Hessian regularisation methods, a polynomial interpolation and approximation module and an implementation of the Chebyshev pseudospectral collocation method, a continuous algebraic Riccati equation (CARE) solver, linear quadratic regulator (LQR), and more.
